@>  What is Appium?
1> Appium is an open-source tool for automating native,
    mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS mobile, Android mobile,
    and Windows desktop platforms. Importantly, Appium is "cross-platform": 
2> it allows you to write tests against multiple platforms
    (iOS, Android, Windows), using the same API.

***********************************************
@> How does it work?
1> Appium test script written in IDE will interact with the Appium
   Server which is nothing but the node server with the specified
   IP address and port number.
2> Node server again passes the request to mobile devices or emulators
   using the uiautomator or XCUITest as a JSON format.
3> All the UI elements associated with the mobile application can
   be controlled by using the appium client which is nothing
   but the derived one of selenium.
4> Note: Remember using Windows only Android can be automated
   while in iOS both Android and iOS can be automated.
